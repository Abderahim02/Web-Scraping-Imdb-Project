# Web-Scraping-Imdb-Project
### Author: Abderahim LAGRAOUI, a second-year Computer Science student at ENSEIRB-MATMECA in Bordeaux.
### Overview:
    This is a mini-project conducted in a Jupyter Notebook environment. It involves practicing web scraping techniques to gather a dataset of films. The project utilizes BeautifulSoup and Requests libraries for parsing HTML pages, and Matplotlib and Seaborn for data visualization.
### Important Note:
    To efficiently test the code, it is recommended to set the parameter 'pages_range' to a value below 1000. Running the code with 'pages_range' set to 6001 may take approximately 10 minutes.
    In case you want to create a large data set, you can leave the same value for that parameter.
